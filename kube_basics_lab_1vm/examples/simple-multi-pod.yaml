# Multi-Container Pod Example
# Demonstrates a Pod with multiple containers that share the same network namespace
# Common pattern: main application container + sidecar for logging, monitoring, or proxy

apiVersion: v1                    # API version for Pod resources
kind: Pod                        # Resource type: Pod

metadata:                        # Metadata about the Pod
  name: simple-multi-pod         # Unique name for the pod

spec:                           # Pod specification
  containers:                   # List of containers (can have multiple)
  - name: main                  # Primary application container
    image: busybox              # Lightweight container image
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Main container starting" && sleep 300']
                                # Command to run: print message and sleep

  - name: sidecar               # Secondary container (sidecar pattern)
    image: busybox              # Same image as main container
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Sidecar starting" && sleep 300']
                                # Sidecar container command
                                # Both containers share network, IPC, and can share volumes
