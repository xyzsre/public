# Basic Pod Example
# This YAML defines a simple Kubernetes Pod with a single container
# Demonstrates the minimum required fields for a functional pod

apiVersion: v1                    # API version for Pod resources (v1 is stable)
kind: Pod                        # Resource type: Pod (smallest deployable unit)

metadata:                        # Metadata about the Pod
  name: basic-pod                # Unique name for the pod within the namespace

spec:                           # Pod specification - defines desired state
  containers:                   # List of containers to run in the pod
  - name: test                  # Unique name for this container within the pod
    image: busybox              # Container image to use (lightweight Linux utilities)
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Pod is running successfully" && sleep 300']
                                # Override default command with custom shell command
                                # Prints success message and sleeps for 5 minutes
